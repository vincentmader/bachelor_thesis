Ever since the first humans looked up into the night sky, ...
people asked themselves ... 
how we got here, whether ... 
we are alone in the cosmos

reference to Carl Sagan


history

(early civilizations?)

planet meaning wanderer (rome?)

heliocentric view, planets orbit the sun, the earth is a planet

became clear that all stars are suns, possibly with their own systems of planets

real evidence for extrasolar planets (exoplanets) only at the end of the 20th 
century, many discovered since then 
($\sim$5000 at the time of writing, cite)

not only observations of exoplanets, but also of protoplanetary disks,
at various different stages of evolution (images)

this gives us insight into the
processes underlying the evolution of (extra-)solar systems and of the 
planets within those systems.

this in turn can help answer questions about our own solar system and its
origin as well as the origin of our home planet Earth, its significance in 
the grander scheme of things 
... and ultimately, deep philosophical questions like ...
the existence of extraterrestrial life.


because of the temporal limitations of a bachelor's thesis
this work can only cover a tiny part of an enormous and active field of 
study.

this work tries to construct a highly simplified model of a protoplanetary
disk (2D) utilizing computer simulations. it is assumed that a ... planet 
has already formed (circumventing problem of early accretion, cite) as is 
orbiting a central star. the evolution of the planet is (obviously) greatly 
influenced by its rate of mass accretion. 
... varying the following parameters: eccentricity of the planet's orbit (!),
initial planet core mass, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, ratio $H/R$, 
Machida factor, disk matter density profile
