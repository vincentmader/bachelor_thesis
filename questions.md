building & running the algorithm
--------------------------------

### building the algorithm
First, the source code has to be compiled. For this, go to './fargo2d1d/src/'.

To clean everything up, do 	
  `make mrproper`

To build sequential, on 1 core, do
  `make BUILD=sequential` 

To build in parallel, on N cores, do
  `make BUILD=parallel`

### running the algorithm
To run sequential, go to './fargo2d1d/' and do
  `./fargo2D1D in/template.par`

To run in parallel, go to './fargo2d1d/' and do
  `mpirun -np #cores ./fargo2D1D -m in/template.par`

For the number of cores, just for an example, I have a resolution of
  * Nr = 802
  * Nphi = 1158
with a 2D grid ranging from 0.15 to 4.5, I run on 6 cores and it takes me
~2 weeks for the simulation to be done for
  * DT = 3.1415
  * Ntot = 10000
  * Nint = 200
(50 outputs with an output every 100 orbits)

### building the algorithm on the MPIA cluster
Before doing the steps from above, openmpi needs to be loaded by writing:
  `module load openmpi-4.0.1`			!! module command not found

And then you can 
  `make mrproper`

and
  `make BUILD=parallel`

### running the algorithm on the MPIA cluster (submitting a simulation)
On the USB stick, you also have a submit.sh file.
This is a submission file for the Bachelor.

The cluster uses SLURM. 			!! find out about SLURM
When you will log in, you will be given different links with
information about how it works. Take a look at this one in particular:

  * https://otrs.mpia.de/otrs/public.pl?Action=PublicFAQZoom;ItemID=197

where you also have a link toward some script examples.
In the one I gave you (which is the one I use), you just have to specify the
name of the job, the partition you want to run on (debug or four-wks),
your email address if you want to receive an email when the jobs
start/fail/complete and the number of cores you want to run the code on.

Just pay attention to write the same number in the --ntasks
and in the mpirun -np lines.

### Did simulation of template file run correctly?
Are the lines in the image the path cleared by the planet?
!!!

#### What exactly does the 'template' simulation do?

### How exactly can I influence the simulation?
You can create/copy/edit a '.par' file in the in directory.

#### How are tabs treated in '.par' files? How do comments work?

### How can I convert the output data from xy to rÏ†?
Output data is stored in a single 1D array, can be reshaped to 2D with
`np.reshape()`. To display in polar coordinates, ...
